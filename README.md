### Objective

Using the language of your choice, you should put into practice programming principles in order to obtain the desired functionality.

### Task

Write a function that accepts 3 arguments: two numbers and one letter. The function should process the numbers according to this description:
- If letter = 'S':

-- A sum will be performed.

-- Both numbers must be integers, otherwise an error message will be shown to the user and on the console.

-- The result of the sum will be shown to the user and on the console.
- If letter = 'R':

-- A subtraction will be performed.

-- Both values must be integers, otherwise an error message will be shown to the user and on the console.

-- The result of the subtraction will be shown to the user and on the console.
- If letter = 'M':

-- A multiplication will be performed.

-- Both values must be positive, otherwise an error message will be shown to the user and on the console.

-- The result of the multiplication will be shown to the user and on the console.
- If letter = 'D':

-- A division will be performed.

-- The denominator cannot be 0, otherwise an error message will be shown to the user and on the console.

-- The result of the division will be shown to the user and on the console.
